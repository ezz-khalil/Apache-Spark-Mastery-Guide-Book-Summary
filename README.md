## 🔍 How to Use

1. **Browse the Summaries**  
   Navigate to `chapters/` and open the `.md` files (e.g., `chapter_4_spark_sql.md`) for detailed chapter summaries with embedded diagrams from `figures/`.

2. **Run the Notebooks**  
   Import notebooks from `notebooks/` into your Databricks workspace to follow along with hands-on demos using datasets from `Datasets/`.

3. **Study by Topic**  
   Each chapter is modular and can be studied independently.
